## Key Findings

### 🎯 **Student Level Insights**
- **Consistent Satisfaction**: All student levels show remarkably similar satisfaction ratings (3.41-3.43/5)
- **Universal Applicability**: AI tools are equally effective across high school, undergraduate, and graduate students
- **Behavior Over Demographics**: Success depends on usage patterns, not academic level

### 📚 **Discipline Performance**
- **Top Performers**: Biology (3.45/5), History (3.44/5), Psychology (3.43/5)
- **Consistent Results**: All disciplines achieve moderate to high satisfaction
- **Broad Applicability**: AI tools work effectively across diverse academic fields

### 🛠️ **Task Type Effectiveness**
- **Most Effective**: Coding tasks (3.46/5 satisfaction, 59.9% completion rate)
- **High Performance**: Homework Help (3.43/5 satisfaction, 50.4% completion rate)
- **Common Usage**: Writing tasks (31% of sessions, 3.41/5 satisfaction)

### 🤖 **AI Assistance Impact**
- **Strong Correlation**: AI assistance level strongly correlates with satisfaction (r = 0.776)
- **Optimal Levels**: Higher assistance levels (4-5) consistently improve outcomes
- **Clear Pattern**: Level 5 achieves 4.67/5 satisfaction vs Level 1 at 1.33/5

## User Segmentation

### 👥 **Three Distinct User Clusters**

#### **Cluster 1: High Satisfaction Users (43.4%)**
- **Profile**: High AI assistance utilization (4.2/5) with excellent satisfaction (4.27/5)
- **Strategy**: Leverage AI tools effectively for optimal results

#### **Cluster 2: Low Satisfaction Users (38.5%)**
- **Profile**: Low AI assistance utilization (2.6/5) with poor satisfaction (2.42/5)
- **Challenge**: Need guidance on effective AI tool usage

#### **Cluster 3: Extended Session Users (18.1%)**
- **Profile**: Longer sessions (42.3 min) with moderate satisfaction (3.49/5)
- **Pattern**: Intensive usage with room for optimization
